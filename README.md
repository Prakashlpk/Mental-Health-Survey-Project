Mental Health Survey Project

This project leverages deep learning to predict the risk of depression from survey data that includes demographic, academic, lifestyle, and medical history factors.

The goal is to provide an early screening tool that is both accurate and fair across diverse groups (gender, age, profession, and city). The solution is deployed as a Streamlit web application hosted on AWS, enabling real-time predictions for end users.
